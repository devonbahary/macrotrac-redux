# React-Redux Starter Template
React-Redux starter template (development) created for forking in future projects. I appreciated the practicality of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), but I wanted to be able to create a React project from scratch and get the gist of all its ingredients.


localhost:8080
`npm run dev-server`

**Features**:
 - *Redux*
 - [Redux DevTools Extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension)
 - React Router
 - SASS
 - [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
 - Webpack configured for development
 - babel plugins
  - [class properties transform](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/)
  - [object rest spread transform](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/)

**Stay tuned for**:
  - future **updates** (will add more dependencies/configurations as seen fit, but the intention is to be minimal)
  - **production** configuration
